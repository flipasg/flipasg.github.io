# TEST STRATEGY

## Unit Tests

- Render each component in isolation with React Testing Library.
- Assert text content, props, and conditional rendering.

## Integration Tests

- Pages/sections render correct composition of components.
- Theme switching works across all sections.

## End-to-End (Optional)

- Verify site navigation, links, and contact form submission (if added).

## Fixtures

- Mock data for `projects.ts`, `skills.ts`, `posts.ts` for predictable tests.
