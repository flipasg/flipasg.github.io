# TESTS & NAMING CONVENTION

- All test files must be placed in a `tests` directory at the project root or alongside the file under test.
- Use `should` in test descriptions instead of `it` (e.g., `test('should render...', ...)`).
- Prefer `test` over `it` for test blocks.
- Update all test files to follow this convention.
